# Overview and Origin

Algorthmic trading is not a new endevour, but developments in technology brought on by big data and increased processing power have opened up opportunities to more investors. But until now, this has not extended into the retail space. 

The concept of using computers to generate trading orders was originally formed in 1949 when commodities trader Richard Donchian used a trend following system for a managed money fund that he founded. 

Some of the greatest financial performances are attributed to Algorthmic trading. Jim Simons is a famous investor, regarded by some as the "the most successful hedge fund manager of all time." His business Renaissance technologies and its staff fund "Medallion Fund" has earned over $100 billion in trading profits since its inception in 1988. This translates to a 66.1% gross return or a 39.1% average net return between 1988 - 2018. 

This level of profitability and performance has been achieved by having the best brains at work, hiring the best mathemtitions in the world and constantly working to refine their models. Obviously something  like this requires deep pockets.

But a startup in Australia is offering backtested trading models to retail investors, unlikely to have the same success as the Medallion Fund, but providing an entry offering, previously only seen in exclusive wealthy circles.

## How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

There are really a combination of two ideas in this product, the first being access to automated Algorthmic trading models, and the second being a low cost investment vehicle for retail investors, that uses algorythms and machine learning. 

## Funding

This company is privately funded, limited by shares. Their website references their shareholders in an interactive digital cloud, this display makes it difficult to say the exact ammount of investors, but it looks to be over 30 ranging from private individuals to limited companies. 

But according to crunchbase Unhedged is funded by 4 investors, with one primary. Littlebanc Advisors LLC. Others are Local VC, Barry Winata, and Palm Ventures. 
## Business Activities:


The company is trying to bring highly advanced investment management techniques to the retail market. Offering retail clients access to three different trading algorythms that require a very low initial investment $100. Most investment funds have a minium $5-10k limit, but this product is available for $100. It also has a very low management fee. 

They derive their income from a low management fee and profit share if and when the fund performs. 

## Intended Customer

The company is appealing to retail investors, with a high risk return appetite, that wishes to allocated <25% of their investable assets into the strategy. According to their "Target Market Determination" document, as required by the Corporations Act. 
 "This investment option is designed to be used within a portfolio where the consumer has a 7 year plus investment timeframe, high risk/return
profile and may need infrequent access to capital". 

## Business Solutions/Competition

Unhedged, has a unique edge in the market as their minimum investment requirements are low ($100) for a product that has proven results in backtesting. There is another fund that has recently launched, Alpha-Vista_Fx-Absolute=return that uses The Fund aims to meet its investment objective through investment
exposure to G-10 currencies. The Fund leverages the Investment
Managerâ€™s big-data and AI technology to quantitatively monitor and
analyse currency markets in real-time
But the difference with this is that it requires a minimum investment of $20k and is related specific to currency. 

## Use of Technologies


All of their trading technology looks to be proprietry and or not declared on stackshare. Their use of reg tech business "cacheinvest" is interesting as it highlights the rapid emergence of this type of business in a short ammount of time. According to stackshare they also use Jquery, react, php, cloudfare, google tag manager, wordpress, font awesome. 


## Landscape- What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Retail investment. Fund management. Wealth management. 


## Major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5 years?


The last 2-3 years has seen the power and voice of retail investors grow, with the increase of free public peer to peer investment forums. The information barrier appears to be lower, or the crowd's liquidity is going further than it did. 

The gamestop incident saw a group of retail investors force the closure of a fund, with retail investors taking excerpts from the funds reportable documents to discover an unpalatably large short position which they were able to exploit. 

The S&P500 has also grown significantly in the last 5 years (up 84%). With record low interest rates and the coincidence of covid, we've seen more people with more time and money to take a closer look at investing.
In the algo space, there has been nothing notable in the retail space, hence the development of this product.  

The larger wholesale managed money funds that use algorythms, have prosperred and lost in some instances. 
Depending on the tenor of the algorythms and their strategy. Covid and the associated stimulus did not suit some stretegies that relay on historic data sets, due to the fact that we havent had an event like that ever,.

## Other major companies in this domain
There are no other companies doing anything similar in this space. But there are plenty of investment companies that target retail investors with Apps and low fees. 
Examples include https://opentrader.com.au/ and they are all trying to distrupt the traditional marketplace of commsec, etrade and cmc markets etc. 

## Business impact of this company so far

The company has generated signficant interest, with over 7000 subscribers. This was clearly beyond their expectations as the app is oversubscribed and investors cannot move from trial to live funding until the backlog is cleared (This could also just be smart marketing..)


## Core metrics/Performance
This company aims to outperform the S&p500 after costs, given that the funds strategies are based on backtesting of algorythms, its currently impossible to test their performance to data. But the core metric of this business is to outperform the market.

Another metric would be client retention, expansion, funds under management. But as its a startup, those metrics are either unavailable or irrelevant. 
Their client growth metrics are clearly being exceeded, given their "oversubscroption" and subsequent waitlist. 

It appears they wanted to come in with a bang, making a lot of noise and disrupt, which they appear to have done.

## Recommendations


Opportunity A

Given the companies nature as a disrputor, I would suggest that they continue to build that audience. But possibly introduce products down the line that require a minimum investment ammount. So they use their status as a disrupter to penetrate the retail market, based on what others arent currently doing. Then once their foot is in the door they start doing what the others are. This is a boring approach, but it wouldnt be hard to leverage the audience for greater profits.

Opportunity B

A better approach and more relevant to their brand positioning, could be to look into becoming a "champion of the retail investor" getting involved with peer to peer forums. Or currently launch their own for clients. 

Opportunity C


Another logical step would be for them to enter the microbanking space. They are building a platform based on low initial investment, so microbanking could be a natural addition.

## Why are recomendations beneficial

Opportunity A is purely just increasing funds under managmenet.

Opportunity B is something that appeals to their current brand positioning as a disrupter, saviour etc. If they could continue to leverage this, then they should flourish more as the crowd continues to grow. 

Opportunity C would help them increase revenue and continue their brand story/image (this is the best one)
